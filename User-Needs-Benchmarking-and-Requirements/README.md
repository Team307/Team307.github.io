# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
---

<br/>

## Summary

_The User Needs assignment was the kick-off to our group's brainstorming for this project, we did not know entirely what our project will end up being but came up with ideas shortly after understanding what the project description was asking for out of us. First, we invested our time in the project description to truly understand what we can and cannot have included in our design. Afterward, we individually did research on similar products and created a VOC chart. We found products that were like the theme of our project was and looked at positive and negative reviews and pulled out what was explicitly and latently being called out in the review. This helped our group weigh out the important needs for what our users will be expecting or should expect._

_Next, we created a Jam Board of sixty needs that our product should have to be a successful product. Each of us jotted down roughly 12 to 15 needs each. After we had the sixty needs, we then sought to organize the needs by color; Blue being the most important need for our design, green being a medium need, and yellow being the lowest need for our group's design. Before we rated our needs, our group compared our needs to what was being called out in VOC reviews and reviewed which of our needs stood out the most of what users are asking for in products. After we organized them in groups by color, we then had our user needs that we felt needed to be implied to our project and design. Our design will be assessed over the aspects we provided in our user needs in many ways. We will approach each assignment and step throughout the building process by looking at our user's needs and verifying that we are following what is important to the users to create a successful design. After each completion of each part of this product, we will refer back to our user needs and ask ourselves the following:_
- _Are we satisfying the needs in our design?_
- _Does this meet the course requirements?_

## Introduction

The Innovation Showcase is an event held at Arizona State University for upper divisional engineering students that showcase their final project to their professors and stakeholders as well as other students that visit and public. The main focus of this event is to explore what engineering students have developed over the course of the semester and see how they apply the knowledge they have gained and infuse it into a functional design. Specifically for Engineering 314 students, their project is to produce a system that interacts and corresponds with the environment and is required to use serial sensing and actuation. Another requirement is that their project/design must broadcast their environmental data using WiFi using the MQTT protocol. Students must include a design that senses at least two environmental conditions and two separate serial sensors. It is also required in the plan to include at least one motor controlled by a motor controller over I2C or SPI-based protocol. The working product of the engineering groups will be presented at the showcase on April 28th, 2023, and will be evaluated by professors for correct functionality as well as meeting the course requirements.

## Objectives

The primary goal of our team is to create a simple yet robust, hands-on design that allows the user to detect a change in temperature in an environment as well as detect the humidity levels in that same environment and display the data on an LED screen. It is important to the design to maintain a focus on inexpensive and reusable materials for the modular components that will be used by the user. Our group's belief is that simple and inexpensive parts and presentations will lead to an impactful learning course for all users that come across our design. Our focus is that anyone of any age and language background could easily pick up the device and understand how to use the system. The final product will consist of two sensors which will allow the user to interpret two environmental conditions and display that data on the screen to the user.

## Stakeholders

**Professors**: The Primary Stakeholders for this project, in charge of looking for and determining the design and project meets expectations. Looking for new and exciting ways for groups to apply their knowledge in their designs and product. Looking for products that sense two environmental conditions while using two sensors. Will disqualify a project if the group is using preexisting products.

**Showcase Visitors**- Public viewers and ASU students that are interested in different products and/or new technologies that they can observe and increase knowledge of current and future environmental data suppliers.

**Volunteers**- Individuals that interact with research teams as well as visitors and provide information, tutorials, and important safety and guidance.

**Research Teams**- Scientists and engineers that are looking to discover new ways to explore how to interpret temperature or other weather-related information. Their research focuses on engagement in interests, identity, and exposure.

<br/>

## Use Cases

**The Visitor**: An outside visitor hears of the showcase that focuses on products that interact with environmental weather conditions and is intrigued. This visitor is constantly outdoors and sometimes in harsh conditions. He/She is looking for something that will be small and compact and sturdy enough to handle severe weather conditions. 

**Hiking Interaction**: This hiker has borrowed a prototype of our product and puts the design to the test when they go on week-long hiking trips. They utilize the device by checking what the temperature is outside and reading off humidity levels in the environment that they are in.
