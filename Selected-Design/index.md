In our second design concept, we will have an enclosed water reservoir with a spray nozzle. The motor will actuate the release mechanism for the mister. A humidity sensor, thermometer, and mister will all be enclosed within a plastic dome. Should the humidity be under a given level at a specified temperature, the motor will activate and mist the dome to bring the humidity to its desired level.
