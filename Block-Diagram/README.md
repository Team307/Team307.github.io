## Summary


_ The Block Diagram is essential for our electrical system design and clearly illustrates which subsystem belongs to who. Each group member is in charge of testing and debugging in order to verify that the subsystem works and is prepared to be tested for the completed subsystem. For Team 307's approach on our block Diagram, we organized the important architecture of our hardware and displayed how the systems are interconnected for working functionality. Included in this Diagram is our ESP32 WiFi modulator which allows for RX/TX communication which allows for sending and receiving information, our Humidity Sensor, and our temperature sensor which meets the criteria for this course to include two serial sensors, the MicroController and the Motor/Motor Driver which fulfills the actuator requirement for our design. 

The TC74 temperature sensor manufactured by Microchip is a serial sensor that measures the temperature. it can measure temperatures between -40C to 125C and outputs information using I2C. the voltage supply range for this sensor is a minimum of 2.7V to 5.5V. This sensor will be surface mounted onto the PCB board.
