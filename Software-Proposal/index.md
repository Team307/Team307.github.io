# Software Proposal

## Software Approach

In group 307 we discussed many approaches on how we wanted our software to run with the goal of meeting our stakeholders need and keeping it relatively simple and easy to understand. The software is divided into 4 sections

* Main Loop
* Initialize System
* Refresh System
* Motor Drivers

In tne Main loop, after the system initialized and determines the state of where the software it is at is when our interupts are enabled. it then reads sensor data and interprets data, if the required value isnt read then it will loop back unti a vaule that is read signals to engage the mister.
