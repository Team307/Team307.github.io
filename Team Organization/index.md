# Team Organization 
---

<br/>

## Summary

_In EGR 314 we formed our group with four members and became group 307. The first event that happened with our group was the exchange of contact information in order for us to be able to communicate properly. We have three sources of contact information which are Texting, emailing, and discord. The primary communication ways will be texting and discord for audio and video chat. In our group, we hold each other accountable for remaining communicative with each other and provide constructive feedback and input whenever it is needed. When our group approached the team charter for our Team Organization assignment, we focused on each member's desired need and want from this class to be successful. Each member provided a statement that ultimately led to what we felt would lead to a successful goal and a promising product. Afterward, our group came together and created the following Team Charter and a meaningful mission Statement._

## Team Charter

Our team strives to have a successful product, we believe that with concise communication and dedication to hard work, and schedule commitment, we can achieve our goals.

A product that meets our stakeholderâ€™s expectations, working with no bugs or other interruptions that can hold the product from being a complete product.
Not only receiving an A on the project but also being able to understand and explain fluidly how the system works.
Building a professional relationship with group members and faculty through thoughtful questions, respectful answers, and clear communication.
Expanding our individual knowledge and skill sets through peer guidance and teaching. We will allow ourselves to not only be available for teaching but to be taught.
Holding ourselves and our team members accountable to the tasks assigned and the standards set forth in this charter. This will create an environment where we are working together as peers toward our common goals.

## Product Mission Statement

**To develop an interactive system that reacts to environmental changes and be displayed at the ASU showcase while achieving our course objectives and requirements.**


Our group believes we have knowledgeable team members and strong-minded individuals who will stay true to the mission statement and follow the team charter religiously. With both these strong Charter and statements, we believe that we will have a successful product for our professors and our stakeholders.
