# MicroController Selection

<br/>

## Summary

Our group 307 sat and researched multiple chips that would work best for our electrical design and we determined that the PIC18F27Q10 Microcontroller was the best fit. we decided to utilize and interpret this microcontroller based on the following attributes the microcontroller has.

    * Supply voltage ranges 1.8V-5.5V
    * inexpensive compared to other microcontrollers
    * 28 GPIO pins
    * Max GPIO pin current is 50mA
    * Supports esternal interupts
    * Surface mount and through hole packages
    * Works with MPLAB and Microchip Code Configurator

 This microcontroller satisfies project-specific requirements and the Microcontroller also comes with the adequate data sheets needed to supply our group with the necessary information to function our group design properly. there is plenty of sample code available via Microchip as well as other trusted resources.
