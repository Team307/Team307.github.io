# Recommendations For Future Students
---


EGR 314 is just as an emotional roller coaster ride as EGR 304 is only you more prepared for the crushing feelings this time around. There have been many moments where our group felt that our project was running smoothly and there were times that our group felt like switching majors. With that being said, our group came together and discussed a list of recommendations for not only future EGR 314 students but for 304 students as well. This list is meant to be viewed as a recommendation for it is based on opinions and our group's view of how the course went for us.

1. If you have an option between Cadence or Kicad in your 304 course, do yourself a favor and do not use Kicad and force yourself to go through the pain of Cadence. This will benefit you greatly because you will have a better idea of the ins and outs of cadence than we did.

2. Give yourself some time to understand MPLabX, it is a very touchy software and can be tedious many times when using it for different Microcontrollers.

3. Following up with MPLabX, there is not enough time to get a full grasp of MQTT and Thotty. We recommend watching educational videos before getting to this segment of the course to understand micropython and how these two programs interact with each other.

4. Communication is gold, create a group text immediately and make sure everyone is aware of what is due and what needs to be done. Not only have communication between your group members but also communicate with the Professor and TAs, unfortunately, information and requirements change frequently and even if you didnt know something or weren't communicated properly, expectations will be held.

5. Utilize as many resources as you can from the classroom, everything you need for testing and debugging is there. If you can't be at the campus as much as you can, invest in tools for your home. Chances are high that you will need to solder or use a voltage meter or need a power supply and going back and forth can be overwhelming.

Our group hopes that this list provides usefulness to future students of EGR 314 as well as 304. As they all say, This too shall pass.
